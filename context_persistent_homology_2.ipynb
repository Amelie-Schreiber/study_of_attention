    "text_2 = [\"Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, offering innovative solutions to complex problems across various industries. Deep learning algorithms, a subset of machine learning, allow computers to learn from vast amounts of data. While a human brain can naturally perform this task, teaching a computer to understand and learn from data is a significant achievement in the realm of artificial intelligence. Deep learning models can identify patterns and reproduce human-like decision-making capabilities, which makes them incredibly valuable for various applications. For instance, in the healthcare sector, deep learning algorithms are being utilized for early detection of diseases and patient care management. Similarly, in the field of autonomous vehicles, deep learning plays a crucial role in enabling these vehicles to understand and interact with their surroundings. By processing and learning from large amounts of data, deep learning models can accurately predict and respond to different situations, thereby ensuring safety and efficiency. Moreover, deep learning is also being used in natural language processing to understand and generate human language. From voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to translation services like Google Translate, deep learning is at the core of these services, enabling them to understand and interact with users in a more human-like manner. Furthermore, deep learning is also paving the way for advancements in the field of image and video processing. From generating high-quality visual effects for movies to improving the quality of video calls, deep learning algorithms are enhancing the way we interact with digital media.\"]"

    "The point that we would like to illustrate is that using persistent homology to perform inform the parameters of a density based clustering algorithm like DBSCAN provides us a way to use individual attention heads to extract collocations and keyphrases of a text. The fact that an individual attention head can be used to find collocations and keyphrases is really fascinating! It also provides us with a way to compare different heads linguistically, as some heads do this better than others, and some tend to find certain collocations and keyphrases better than other collocations and keyphrases. So, we could potentially use this to better train models, or select which heads to apply Low Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) to in place of fine-tuning the entire model. In other words, if we train a LoRA to modify the behavior of individual attention heads so that they better detect certain collocations and keyphrases for different kinds of text corpora, we can get a more robust model overall. We might also use this to better find problematic knowledge that the model has learned and train this out of the model using a LoRA in place of fine tuning the entire model. We can test how each individual attention head behaves over a wide range of text corpora that is known to have certain kinds of problematic information in it, and deter the model from focusing on this kind of knowledge, treating its context vectors as \"noise\" (in terms of the DBSCAN). We can also use this to train models to detect problematic material in content. "
