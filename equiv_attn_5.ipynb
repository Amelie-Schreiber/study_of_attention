    "We start with the formalism of dessin d'enfants because it provides a unified mathematical framework for tokenizing complicated graphs embedded in Riemann surfaces like multi-holed tori. For an introduction, please see [Graphs on Surfaces and Their Applications](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/Classes/Math8680Fall2014Papers/LandoZvonkin.pdf). Let $[\\sigma, \\alpha]$ be a rotation system with $\\sigma \\in S_{2n}$ a permutation giving the vertices of the graph, attaches to half-edges. Let $\\alpha \\in S_{2n}$ be a permutation that is an involution, that is $\\alpha^2 = \\alpha$, which tells use how to glue the half-edges around the \"stars\" associated to each cycle of $\\sigma$. The involution $\\alpha$ can be thought of as making the graph a bipartite graph, by labeling each full edge by a white \"edge node\" that represents one of the two-cycles of $\\alpha$. We can then color the vertex nodes of $\\sigma$ black, and the edge nodes of $\\alpha$ white, making the graph bipartite. Now, the dual graph can be computed as follows. We replace $\\sigma$ with $\\phi = (\\sigma \\alpha)^{-1}$ and forms the dual dessin $[\\phi, \\alpha]$. This corresponds to adding in face nodes according to $\\phi$, each with half-edges that are connected according to $\\alpha$. There is a node on every face, and the edges connect neighboring faces that share an edge on the boundary. This again makes $[\\phi, \\alpha]$ a bipartite, cellularly embedded graph in the Riemann surface $\\Sigma$. It is the geometric dual graph of $[\\sigma, \\alpha]$. \n",

    "Now, we would like to tokenize any such graph, treating vertex, edge, and face nodes as tokens, and given a vector embedding $X$, which can ve thought of as a functions $\\Phi:\\Gamma \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\\Gamma$ is the graph obtained by overlaying $[\\sigma, \\alpha]$ and $[\\phi, \\alpha]$ in the surface $\\Sigma$.

Similarly, we can restrict $\\Phi_E: E \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ giving edge feature vectors $\\Phi(e) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ for each edge $e \\in E$. Finally, we can also restrict $\\Phi_F: F \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ giving a function $\\Phi_F \\in L_{\\mathbb{R}^d}(F)$, where $\\Phi(f) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ for each face $f \\in F$.

    "\n",
    "1. Graph Laplacian positional encodings: Graph Laplacian positional encodings can capture the local connectivity of a graph, including its dual, and can be used to encode the position of nodes relative to each other. They are computed using the graph Laplacian matrix, which considers the connectivity of the graph. These encodings can capture local information and might be a suitable choice for the attention mechanism applied to the tokenization of a graph and its dual. However, they might not fully capture the global structure of the graph and its embedding in a Riemann surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relative positional encodings: Relative positional encodings are designed to capture the relative position of elements in a sequence or structure, making them suitable for encoding the position of nodes in the torus code. Since the torus code is essentially an image pixel grid on the torus, and relative positional encodings have been shown to work well for images, they could be an appropriate choice. However, it is crucial to adapt the relative positional encodings to the graph setting and take into account the specific structure of the torus code, including vertex, edge, and face nodes."

    "## Possible Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Molecular Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the Riemann surface-based graph attention mechanism to molecular property prediction, we first need to represent the molecular structure as a graph embedded in a Riemann surface. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Molecular graph representation: Start by representing the molecule as a graph $\\Gamma(M)$, where the atoms in the molecule are the vertices and the chemical bonds between the atoms are the edges. Each vertex is associated with a feature vector representing the atom's properties (e.g., atomic number, electronegativity), and each edge is associated with a feature vector representing the bond properties (e.g., bond type, bond order).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rotation system representation: In order to obtain a rotation system $[\\sigma, \\alpha]$ for the graph $\\Gamma(M)$, we need to assign a cyclic order to the edges incident to each vertex and an involution to the half-edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "   (a) For each vertex, pick an arbitrary starting edge and then order the incident edges in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. This ordering defines the permutation $\\sigma \\in S_{2n}$, which represents the vertices and their connections to half-edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (b) Define the involution $\\alpha \\in S_{2n}$ by pairing each half-edge with the half-edge on the opposite side of the bond it belongs to. Since each bond connects two half-edges, $\\alpha$ will always be an involution, i.e., $\\alpha^2 = \\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dual graph and dessin d'enfants: Compute the dual graph $[\\phi, \\alpha]$ by replacing $\\sigma$ with $\\phi = (\\sigma \\alpha)^{-1}$, forming a bipartite cellularly embedded graph in the Riemann surface $\\Sigma$. The dessin d'enfants representation allows us to work with a unified mathematical framework for the graph and its dual.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tokenization: Tokenize the graph $\\Gamma(M)$ by considering vertex, edge, and face nodes. Assign feature vectors to each type of node using the previously mentioned feature functions $\\Phi_V$, $\\Phi_E$, and $\\Phi_F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Riemann surface-based graph attention mechanism: Apply the previously defined multihead self-attention mechanism on the tokenized graph, considering the three types of nodes (vertex, edge, and face nodes). Use suitable positional encodings to capture the relationships between nodes, considering the graph structure and the embedding in the Riemann surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation and prediction: After applying the graph attention mechanism, aggregate the node features to obtain a single vector representing the entire molecular graph. This can be done using techniques such as pooling, summing, or averaging the node features. Finally, use a task-specific output layer to make predictions for the molecular properties of interest (e.g., solubility, toxicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can apply the Riemann surface-based graph attention mechanism to molecular property prediction. The key aspect is the ability to capture complex topological and geometrical properties of the molecular graph, which can help improve the model's performance in predicting various properties of the molecule. We also note possible applications to quantum error crrection. "

    "### Quantum Surface Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum surface codes are a class of quantum error-correcting codes used to protect quantum information against errors in quantum computation. The codes are defined on two-dimensional lattices or graphs embedded in Riemann surfaces, with qubits associated with either the edges, vertices, or faces of the graph. The geometric dual graph of the original graph is also embedded in the same Riemann surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of quantum surface codes, a graph $\\Gamma_1$ embedded in a Riemann surface $\\Sigma$ can represent the lattice of the surface code, and its geometric dual graph $\\Gamma_2$ can represent the dual lattice, which is also embedded in $\\Sigma$. The combined graph $\\Gamma = \\Gamma_1 \\cup \\Gamma_2$ encodes the structure of both the original and dual lattices.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using graph-based transformer models with attention mechanisms and positional encodings, as described earlier, we can effectively process and analyze quantum surface codes. The Laplacian positional encoding captures the structural information of the graph, including the connectivity and the relative positions of nodes, which are essential for understanding the topology of the Riemann surface and the error-correcting properties of the quantum surface code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying the transformer model to quantum surface codes, the feature map $f$ can represent physical properties associated with the qubits, such as error probabilities, local noise correlations, or other relevant information. By incorporating this information along with the Laplacian positional encoding, the transformer can learn to identify and correct errors in the quantum surface code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the graph-based transformer model with attention mechanisms and Laplacian positional encodings can be applied to quantum surface codes represented by graphs cellularly embedded in Riemann surfaces and their geometric dual graphs. This approach enables the effective processing of quantum surface codes, taking into account both the topological structure of the Riemann surface and the physical properties of the qubits."
